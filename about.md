Hi! My name is Srijith and I am a Mobile App Developer currently working for ThoughtWorks. I love learning new programming languages and frameworks, and sharing interesting stuffs about them.

I love music and singing, reading books Checkout my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/97465253-srijith){:target="_blank"} profile.

This is the medium I use to share my thoughts.
